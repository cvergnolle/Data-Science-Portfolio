In this project, I gathered and consolidated data from all existing D1 college football teams. I then performed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and selected relevant features before employing an XGBoost algorithm to forecast the revenue generated by the football programs of various universities.

Utilized historical market information to build a model to assess a stock portfolio's risk and return in relation to a market index fund, taking into account the betas of individual stocks and the weighted sum of asset betas to compute the portfolio beta.
