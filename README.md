# Data Science Portfolio

## Introduction

Hello, my name is Corentin Vergnolle and I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Santa Barbara. I graduated from the Letters & Science Honors Program with a double major in Statistics & Data Science and Economics & Accounting.

My primary focus is on developing my skills as a data analyst and using those skills to help drive business value in my next position. If you have any suggestions, feedback on my projects, or job opportunities, please don't hesitate to contact me at one of the links below.

## Projects

<img align="left" width="250" height="175" src="Images/Gold.png"> **[Gold Price Prediction](https://github.com/cvergnolle/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/e90b0245d7c3a93a9d93bee622e87e5fa56d40f5/Projects/Gold%20Price%20Prediction/PSTAT131FinalProject.html)**

Conducted EDA, feature engineering, cross-validation, and tuning to build a model that predicts 24-hour gold price changes using over 15 predictors and machine learning models, achieving a mean RMSE of 19.5. Scraped and cleaned data from multiple sources to compile a dataset of economic indicators, lag variables, and calculated variables, and applied both time-series and independent-observation models for analysis.

In this project, I gathered and consolidated data from all existing D1 college football teams. I then performed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and selected relevant features before employing an XGBoost algorithm to forecast the revenue generated by the football programs of various universities.

Utilized historical market information to build a model to assess a stock portfolio's risk and return in relation to a market index fund, taking into account the betas of individual stocks and the weighted sum of asset betas to compute the portfolio beta.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="Images/Customer Churn.png"> **[Bank Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/cvergnolle/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/cfdc857257fed70bd7aefd09eec048d87238478a/Projects/Customer%20Churn%20Prediction)**

This study aims to identify and visualize factors contributing to customer churn and develop a prediction model to classify customer churn while potentially assigning probabilities to facilitate targeted customer service efforts in churn prevention.
